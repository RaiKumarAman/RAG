# LangChain Utilities: Text Splitters & Document Loaders

This repository contains two core components from the [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) ecosystem:

- 📄 **Text Splitters** – Divide long texts into manageable, context-aware chunks.
- 📚 **Document Loaders** – Load and preprocess documents from various sources into a unified format for use in LLM pipelines.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```

langchain-text-splitters/

````

Each directory contains utility modules for building custom LLM-based applications.

## ✂️ Text Splitters

LangChain's text splitters intelligently segment documents based on character count, token count, or custom rules—ideal for feeding into language models.

### 🔧 Features

- Recursive character-based splitting
- Token-based splitting (OpenAI, HuggingFace)
- Custom separators and metadata handling
- Configurable chunk overlap

### ✅ Example

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
chunks = splitter.split_text("Your long text document here...")
````

## 📄 Document Loaders

Document loaders transform raw files into LangChain-compatible `Document` objects. They support a wide variety of formats and sources.

### 📦 Supported Formats

* 📄 PDF: PyPDF, PDFMiner, PyMuPDF
* 📝 Markdown, HTML, TXT
* 🌐 Web pages
* 🧠 Notion, Obsidian
* ☁️ Amazon S3, Google Drive
* 🧱 Unstructured documents

### ✅ Example

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

loader = PyPDFLoader("sample.pdf")
docs = loader.load()
```

---

## 💡 Use Cases

* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines
* Document QA bots
* LLM-powered search engines
* Semantic search with FAISS, Chroma, or Pinecone
* Summarization or chunk-level classification

---

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install only what you need based on your loader/splitter.
